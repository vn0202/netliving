As expats, we&#8217;re often in for a pleasant surprise when we realize just how much value we get for our money compared to our home countries. Yet, why do we sometimes find ourselves grumbling about rental prices? Is there more to it, or are landlords simply padding their pockets?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hanoi, with its myriad neighborhoods, offers expats the cozy embrace of small communities teeming with familiar conveniences. We gravitate towards shops stocked with comforts from home and bars where we can forge friendships in this new, albeit strange, land we&#8217;ve come to call home. Language barriers make mingling with locals daunting, so our expat bubbles become all the more inviting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s talk prices. Tay Ho&#8217;s apartment rates can vary as much as the hues of a sunset. When we hear &#8220;serviced apartment,&#8221; we conjure images of cleaning services, running tap water, and the basics covered within our rent. How spoiled are we that this is the norm? Back home in South Africa, such luxuries are a far cry from rental realities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hold on, not all serviced apartments are cut from the same cloth. While some offer the basics, others, particularly those nestled in our preferred locales, adopt a &#8220;customer-first&#8221; ethos. These are the gems catering to corporate honchos, elite school faculty, and embassy staff. Picture emergency exits, fire alarms, sprinklers in every room, and round-the-clock security. Think laundry services, with your bedding magically refreshed, and a management team poised to tackle any concern. Sure, these luxury havens come with a price tag, but they cater perfectly to expat housing allowances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those without a housing stipend, fear not! Tay Ho boasts a treasure trove of serviced apartments at more wallet-friendly rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Location, my friend, is everything! Each area has its charms and quirks, so pick your poison wisely. Looking for top-notch services? Not every nook and cranny will oblige. Take Yen Phu, for instance; it&#8217;s got a handful of apartments with the full-service shebang. Then there&#8217;s Truc Bach, still holding onto its French colonial charm, yet to embrace the sleek modernity many expats crave. Brace yourself for the local flavor in these outskirt areas\u2014roosters crowing, street food vendors beckoning, and the occasional karaoke serenade. Embrace it; it&#8217;s all part of the tapestry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ba Dinh, on the other hand, offers a deep dive into Vietnamese life\u2014a cultural immersion you&#8217;ll crave long after you&#8217;ve left.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider your temperament when choosing your slice of Tay Ho. If you&#8217;re adaptable, ready to embrace the symphony of urban sounds, the city is your oyster. But if peace and quiet are non-negotiable, luxurious compounds like Elegant Suites or Ciputra might be your sanctuary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Tay Ho, the journey to find your perfect serviced apartment is as exhilarating as the destination itself. So, go forth, explore, and may your search be as rewarding as the experiences that await you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feel free to follow us on instagram to follow area previews and properties on offer in them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NEST.VN<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image from: Secret.hanoi instagram page<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Exploring Serviced Apartments: Unraveling the Tapestry of Tay Ho Living Have you ever stopped to ponder the intricacies of renting a serviced apartment in Hanoi&#8217;s bustling Tay Ho district?
